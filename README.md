# MonteCarlo
## Introduction
Monte Carlo algorithms return answers with a random amount of error. The 
amount of error can typically be reduced by expending more resources 
(usually running time and memory). For any fixed computational budget, a 
Monte Carlo algorithm can provide an approximate answer.
